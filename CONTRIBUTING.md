### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: tell about the development, added by bb
- **qa-needed**: tell about the qa needed, added by bb
- **documentation-needed**: tell about the documentation needed, added by bb
- **bug-high-priority**: tell about the high priority bugs, added by bb
- **bug-low-priority**: tell about the low priority bugs, added by bb
- **help-wanted**: tell about the wanted help, added by bb

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
